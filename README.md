# website
Web code for http://swwurster.com.

A python Flask server is responsible for serving all static and dynamic content within the website. This allows me to easily interface with trained PyTorch models, such as one I trained to generate heightmaps (http://swwurster.com/projects/GAN_heightmaps.html).

The server runs on a Raspberry Pi 4 (4GB) I have sitting on my desk.
