<p>
    This is a single Unity project housing scenes made for labs for CSE 3541: Computer Game and Animation Techniques taken in Fall 2017 at OSU. </p>

â€‹
<p>
Each scene is labelled as which lab it was, and has a README for it to understand the objective, implementation, and nuances in the code.</p>

<p>
This class was easily my favorite taken, but that spot is now taken by neural networks or geometric modeling!</p>
